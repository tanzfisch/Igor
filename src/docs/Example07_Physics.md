Physics Example                                             {#example07}
===============

The physics part of Igor is still under development. Therefore the example code is not final so it does not make too much sense writing a Tutorial just yet.

However here is a link to the current code 
[example](https://github.com/tanzfisch/Igor/blob/master/examples/07%20Physics/src/PhysicsExample.cpp).

And here an other link to a video of the current example [Physics](https://youtu.be/Mxy_4jwUmVo).
