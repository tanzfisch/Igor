Igor Code Style Guide

### Variables
All variables start with a lower case letter.
If the Variable Name contain more than one word from the second word on every first letter of every word must be in upper case. Every other letter can be written in upper or lower case.

Examples:
i
output
nodeIndex
nodeID
incredibleLongVariableName

### Member Variables
All member variables and static definitions start with an underscore "_"

Examples:
_matrix
_fooBar

### Functions and Methods
All functions and methods start with a lower case letter. From the second word on every first letter of a word must be written in upper case. Every other letter can be in upper case too.
The first word is preferably a verb.

Examples:
void runThis();
int getID();
void update();

### Classes, Structs and Enums
All names of classes, structs and enums start with the prefixes according to the name space they are part off.
For the Igor name space this is "i" and for the IgorAux name space this is "ia".
After the prefix every first letter of every word must be upper case every other letter can be upper case.

Examples:
class iMatrixf
enum iaConsoleColor

Examples

### {} Brackets and Indentation
Use {} brackets and indentation in a way to make clear how nested the code is and where nesting starts and ends. Don't try to hide nesting.

Bad
if(foo == bar)
	x = 1;
	
for(int i=0;i<10;++i)
	if(i==bar)
	x = 0;

Poor
if(foo == bar){
	x = 1;
}
	
for(int i=0;i<10;++i){
	if(i==bar){
		x = 0;
	}
}
	
Good
if(foo == bar)
{
	x = 1;
}

for(int i=0;i<10;++i)
{
	if(i==bar)
	{
		x = 0;
	}
}


### Documentation
All symbols must be documented with doxygen style comments. No mater if internal or external interfaces. No mater if public or private members and methods.

Example:

/*! This class is the greatest.
*/
class Bla
{
	private:
	
		/*! private member index
		
		\todo do we need this one?
		*/
		int _index;
		
		/*! does nothing
		*/
		void fooBar();
	
	public:

		/*! does nothing
		
		\param word bird is the
		\returns always zero
		*/
		int fooBar(const string& word);

		/*! does some magic
		*/
		Bla();
		
		/*! cleans up
		*/
		~Bla();
}
